                <p>Foodly is a platform that is unique to each of its three user-base, average users, restaurant owners, and the app owner. With a separate login and user profile, it offers a distinct dashboard with unique features that suit their needs.</p>
                <p>Average users can login to place their order through the app and track it from when it is in processing, confirmed, in preparation, and on its way to your home. Furthermore, the in-app wallet converts the dollars spent into reward points that can be traded for more purchases. It also lists points earned per restaurant so users can track where they spent.</p>
